### A tiny js 2d physics engine that can't do much

Developed in order to ellegantly separate overlapping html elements without using a full physics lib.

`gulp example` runs an example page on locahost:3000

`gulp build` builds a plain-js module in /dist

No documentation yet and who knows if ever.
